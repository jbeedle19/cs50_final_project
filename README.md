## Description
A web application where users can search for a movie or tv show and find out which streaming services are offering it. Once a user searches for the title they will see a list of results to choose from. The list will also display a poster and the year for each title to help the user find the correct movie or tv show. On the details page, a user can follow one of the links to their preferred streaming service and start watching. If a user registers for an account then they can also add the show or movie to their own watchlist to watch at a later time. Logged in users are able to edit their watchlist by adding more items or deleting tv shows and/or movies they have already seen.
